# NeuralTitanicMatrixUpdate
This is an upgrade from the ground up of NeuralTitanic (https://github.com/bhaisting/NeuralNetworkTitanic) to use matrix multiplication.
This allows for the system to be implemented far more generally than was previously possible by allowing different amounts of neurons at each step. The program has also been further optimized and cleaned up for better use.
